    CPU Time: 2.907s
    Memory Bound: 61.6% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction
     | of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load
     | and stores. Explore the metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory
     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.
     |
        L1 Bound: 22.4% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
         | L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency.
         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load
         | might suffer a high latency even though it is being satisfied by the
         | L1.
         |
        L2 Bound: 9.5% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache. Avoiding
         | cache misses (L1 misses/L2 hits) will improve the latency and
         | increase performance.

 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization caused by load imbalance, threading runtime overhead, contended
 | synchronization, or thread/process underutilization. Explore sub-metrics to
 | estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP parallelism or run the Locks and
 | Waits analysis to identify parallel bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.
