    Memory Bound: 100.0% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction
     | of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load
     | and stores. Explore the metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory
     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.

        L1 Bound: 15.6% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
         | L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency.
         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load
         | might suffer a high latency even though it is being satisfied by the
         | L1.
         |
        L2 Bound: 5.0% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache. Avoiding
         | cache misses (L1 misses/L2 hits) will improve the latency and

    Retiring: 100.0% of Pipeline Slots
     | A high fraction of pipeline slots was utilized by useful work. While the
     | goal is to make this metric value as big as possible, a high Retiring
     | value for non-vectorized code could prompt you to consider code
     | vectorization. Vectorization enables doing more computations without

        Heavy Operations: 23.5% of Pipeline Slots
         | CPU retired heavy-weight operations (instructions that required 2+
         | uops) in a significant fraction of cycles.
         |
            Few Uops Instructions: 16.9% of Pipeline Slots
             | This metric represents fraction of slots where the CPU was
             | retiring instructions that that are decoder into two or up to
             | ([SNB+] four; [ADL+] five) uops. This highly-correlates with the
             | number of uops in such instructions.
             |
            Microcode Sequencer: 6.6% of Pipeline Slots
             | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was spent retiring uOps
             | fetched by the Microcode Sequencer.
             | 
             | Tips:
             | 
             | 1. Make sure the /arch compiler flags are correct.
             | 
             | 2. Check the child Assists metric and, if it is highlighted as an
             | issue, follow the provided recommendations.
             | 
             | Note that this metric value may be highlighted due to MS Switches
             | issue.
             |
                Assists: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
                CISC: 6.6% of Pipeline Slots
    Front-End Bound: 34.9% of Pipeline Slots
     | Issue: A significant portion of Pipeline Slots is remaining empty due to
     | issues in the Front-End.
     | 
     | Tips:  Make sure the code working size is not too large, the code layout
     | does not require too many memory accesses per cycle to get enough
     | instructions for filling four pipeline slots, or check for microcode
     | assists.
     |
        Front-End Latency: 13.0% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents a fraction of slots during which CPU was
         | stalled due to front-end latency issues, such as instruction-cache
         | misses, ITLB misses or fetch stalls after a branch misprediction. In
         | such cases, the front-end delivers no uOps.
         |
            ICache Misses: 0.0% of Clockticks
            ITLB Overhead: 0.1% of Clockticks
            Branch Resteers: 0.5% of Clockticks
                Mispredicts Resteers: 0.5% of Clockticks
                Clears Resteers: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Unknown Branches: 0.0% of Clockticks
            DSB Switches: 0.4% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant portion of cycles is spent switching from
             | the DSB to the MITE.  This may happen if a hot code region is too
             | large to fit into the DSB.
             | 
             | Tips: Consider changing code layout (for example, via profile-
             | guided optimization) to help your hot regions fit into the DSB.
             | 
             | See the "Optimization for Decoded ICache" section in the Intel 64
             | and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual.
             |
            Length Changing Prefixes: 0.0% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to Length
             | Changing Prefixes (LCPs).
             | 
             | Tips: To avoid this issue, use proper compiler flags. Intel
             | Compiler enables these flags by default.
             | 
             | See the "Length-Changing Prefixes (LCP)" section in the Intel 64
             | and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual.
             |
            MS Switches: 3.9% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to
             | switches of uOp delivery to the Microcode Sequencer (MS).
             | Commonly used instructions are optimized for delivery by the DSB
             | or MITE pipelines. Certain operations cannot be handled natively
             | by the execution pipeline, and must be performed by microcode
             | (small programs injected into the execution stream). Switching to
             | the MS too often can negatively impact performance. The MS is
             | designated to deliver long uOp flows required by CISC
             | instructions like CPUID, or uncommon conditions like Floating
             | Point Assists when dealing with Denormals. Note that this metric
             | value may be highlighted due to Microcode Sequencer issue.
             |
        Front-End Bandwidth: 22.0% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents a fraction of slots during which CPU was
         | stalled due to front-end bandwidth issues, such as inefficiencies in
         | the instruction decoders or code restrictions for caching in the DSB
         | (decoded uOps cache). In such cases, the front-end typically delivers
         | a non-optimal amount of uOps to the back-end.
         |
            Front-End Bandwidth MITE: 2.6% of Pipeline Slots
                Decoder-0 Alone: 0.1% of Pipeline Slots
                %MITE_4wide: 0.5% of Clockticks
            Front-End Bandwidth DSB: 12.7% of Pipeline Slots
            (Info) DSB Coverage: 66.2%
             | Issue: A significant fraction of uOps was not delivered by the
             | DSB (known as Decoded ICache or uOp Cache). This may happen if a
             | hot code region is too large to fit into the DSB.
             | 
             | Tips: Consider changing the code layout (for example, via
             | profile-guided optimization) to help your hot regions fit into
             | the DSB.
             | 
             | See the "Optimization for Decoded ICache" section in the Intel 64
             | and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual.
             |
            (Info) DSB Misses: 100.0% of Pipeline Slots
             | %DSB_MissesIssueTextAll
             |
    Bad Speculation: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
        Branch Mispredict: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
        Machine Clears: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 100.0% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 100.0% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.
         |
            L1 Bound: 11.2% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing
             | the L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest
             | latency. However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older
             | stores, a load might suffer a high latency even though it is
             | being satisfied by the L1. Note that this metric value may be
             | highlighted due to DTLB Overhead or Cycles of 1 Port Utilized
             | issues.
             |
                DTLB Overhead: 100.0% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant portion of cycles is being spent
                 | handling first-level data TLB misses.
                 | 
                 | Tips:
                 | 
                 | 1.  As with ordinary data caching, focus on improving data
                 | locality and reducing the working-set size to minimize the
                 | DTLB overhead.
                 | 
                 | 2. Consider using profile-guided optimization (PGO) to
                 | collocate frequently-used data on the same page.
                 | 
                 | 3. Try using larger page sizes for large amounts of
                 | frequently-used data.
                 |
                    Load STLB Hit: 100.0% of Clockticks
                     | In significant fraction of cycles the (first level) DTLB
                     | was missed by load accesses, that later on hit in second-
                     | level TLB (STLB).
                     |
                    Load STLB Miss: 0.4% of Clockticks
                Loads Blocked by Store Forwarding: 0.3% of Clockticks
                Lock Latency: 0.1% of Clockticks
                 | A significant fraction of CPU cycles spent handling cache
                 | misses due to lock operations. Due to the microarchitecture
                 | handling of locks, they are classified as L1 Bound regardless
                 | of what memory source satisfied them. Note that this metric
                 | value may be highlighted due to Store Latency issue.
                 |
                Split Loads: 5.7% of Clockticks
                4K Aliasing: 29.0% of Clockticks
                 | Issue: A significant proportion of cycles is spent dealing
                 | with false 4k aliasing between loads and stores.
                 | 
                 | Tips: Use the source/assembly view to identify the aliasing
                 | loads and stores, and then adjust your data layout so that
                 | the loads and stores no longer alias.
                 | 
                 |  See the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization
                 | Reference Manual for more details.
                 |
                FB Full: 1.7% of Clockticks
                 | This metric does a rough estimation of how often L1D Fill
                 | Buffer unavailability limited additional L1D miss memory
                 | access requests to proceed. The higher the metric value, the
                 | deeper the memory hierarchy level the misses are satisfied
                 | from. Often it hints on approaching bandwidth limits (to L2
                 | cache, L3 cache or external memory). Avoid adding software
                 | prefetches if indeed memory BW limited.
                 |
            L2 Bound: 7.2% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache.
             | Avoiding cache misses (L1 misses/L2 hits) will improve the
             | latency and increase performance.
             |
            L3 Bound: 3.4% of Clockticks
                Contested Accesses: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Data Sharing: 3.8% of Clockticks
                L3 Latency: 2.0% of Clockticks
                SQ Full: 3.2% of Clockticks
            DRAM Bound: 1.7% of Clockticks
                Memory Bandwidth: 3.3% of Clockticks
                Memory Latency: 11.9% of Clockticks
                    Local Memory: 4.8% of Clockticks
                    Remote Memory: 0.0% of Clockticks
                    Remote Cache: 0.0% of Clockticks
            Store Bound: 9.8% of Clockticks

                Streaming Stores: 0.0% of Clockticks
                DTLB Store Overhead: 25.7% of Clockticks
                    Store STLB Hit: 24.2% of Clockticks
                    Store STLB Miss: 1.5% of Clockticks
        Core Bound: 100.0% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).
         |
            Divider: 6.4% of Clockticks
            Port Utilization: 77.3% of Clockticks
             | Issue: A significant fraction of cycles was stalled due to Core
             | non-divider-related issues.
             | 
             | Tips: Use vectorization to reduce pressure on the execution ports
             | as multiple elements are calculated with same uOp.
             |
                Cycles of 0 Ports Utilized: 2.4% of Clockticks
                    Serializing Operations: 17.9% of Clockticks
                        Slow Pause: 8.7% of Clockticks
                    Mixing Vectors: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Cycles of 1 Port Utilized: 17.4% of Clockticks
                 | This metric represents cycles fraction where the CPU executed
                 | total of 1 uop per cycle on all execution ports (Logical
                 | Processor cycles since ICL, Physical Core cycles otherwise).
                 | This can be due to heavy data-dependency among software
                 | instructions, or oversubscribing a particular hardware
                 | resource. In some other cases with high 1_Port_Utilized and
                 | L1 Bound, this metric can point to L1 data-cache latency
                 | bottleneck that may not necessarily manifest with complete
                 | execution starvation (due to the short L1 latency e.g.
                 | walking a linked list) - looking at the assembly can be
                 | helpful. Note that this metric value may be highlighted due
                 | to L1 Bound issue.
                 |
                Cycles of 2 Ports Utilized: 19.3% of Clockticks
                 | This metric represents cycles fraction CPU executed total of
                 | 2 uops per cycle on all execution ports (Logical Processor
                 | cycles since ICL, Physical Core cycles otherwise). Tip: Loop
                 | Vectorization - most compilers feature auto-Vectorization
                 | options today- reduces pressure on the execution ports as
                 | multiple elements are calculated with same uop.
